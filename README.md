# Global Optimization in Matrix Sensing
This is a repository for the code supporting the paper Global Optimization in Matrix Sensing. It's written in Matlab and run with R2019a (you woluld need to have the MATLAB environment installed to run it)

The code is organised into floders, each containing scripts which are reproducing the numerical results reported in a particular section of the paper. The folder `util` contains the auxillary functions.

### Instructions
